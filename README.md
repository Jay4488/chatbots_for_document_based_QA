# chatbots-for-document-based-Q-A.

üîπ Summary of the Notebook
Purpose:
To create a vector-based document retrieval system using ChromaDB and integrate it with a Generative AI model for intelligent querying and responses.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Tools and Libraries Used:
ChromaDB: For storing and querying vector embeddings.

LangChain: For chaining AI and data logic.

HuggingFaceEmbeddings: To embed text into vectors.

GoogleGenerativeAI (via LangChain): For LLM responses.

PDFMinerLoader and DirectoryLoader: To load documents, especially PDFs.

.env file: Used to manage API keys securely.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Workflow:
Import Libraries
Includes all necessary modules from LangChain, ChromaDB, HuggingFace, etc.

Load Environment Variables
Uses .env file to securely load API keys for Google Generative AI.

Load and Parse Documents
Loads PDF documents from a directory using PDFMinerLoader.

Embed Documents
Converts textual data into vector embeddings using HuggingFaceEmbeddings.

Store in Vector Database
Stores these embeddings into a local Chroma vector database.

Query with LLM Integration
Accepts user queries, finds relevant document chunks using vector similarity, and feeds them into Google Generative AI to generate contextual answers.

üìå Applications:
Building AI-powered chatbots for document-based Q&A.

Creating searchable knowledge bases from PDFs or text.

Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
